        "\n",
        "> > In Python, encapsulation is typically achieved through the use of **private and protected attributes** and by providing **public methods** (also known as getters and setters) to access and modify those attributes. While Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like `public`, `private`, or `protected` as found in some other languages (like Java or C++), it uses naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility and relies on the convention that users of the class will respect these conventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Mechanisms in Python:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Single Underscore (`_`):**\n",
        "    *   A single underscore prefix (e.g., `_attribute`) is a convention to indicate that the attribute or method is \"protected\".\n",
        "    *   It suggests that the attribute/method is intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses.\n",
        "    *   However, it's merely a convention, and the attribute/method can still be accessed from outside the class. Python doesn't strictly prevent access.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Double Underscore (`__`):**\n",
        "    *   A double underscore prefix (e.g., `__attribute`) is used for \"name mangling\".\n",
        "    *   Python renames these attributes internally to make them harder to access accidentally from outside the class. For a class named `MyClass`, `__attribute` would be internally renamed to something like `_MyClass__attribute`.\n",
        "    *   This provides a stronger form of privacy, although it's still not impossible to access these attributes if you know the mangled name.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Getters and Setters (Public Methods):**\n",
        "    *   The recommended way to interact with potentially \"private\" data is through public methods.\n",
        "    *   **Getter methods** are used to retrieve the value of an attribute.\n",
        "    *   **Setter methods** are used to modify the value of an attribute, often with validation or additional logic.\n",

        "**Significance and Use Cases:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Cleanup Operations:** The primary purpose of `__del__` is to perform cleanup operations before an object is removed from memory. This might include:\n",
        "    *   Closing file handles or network connections.\n",
        "    *   Releasing external resources (like database connections).\n",

        "*   **Unpredictable Timing:** The garbage collector runs at unpredictable times, so you cannot rely on `__del__` being called immediately after an object is no longer referenced.\n",

        "*   **Context Managers (`with` statement):** For reliable resource management (like files), it's generally recommended to use context managers (`with` statement) with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods instead of `__del__`. Context managers guarantee that cleanup code is executed, even if errors occur.\n",

        "**In Summary:**\n",
